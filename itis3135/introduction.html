            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Personal Background:</span>  I was born in Florida but moved here to Mint Hill, NC when I was two. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Professional Background:</span> 
                    I started here at UNCC fall of 2022 but decided to switch and go to CPCC. 
                    I got my associates degree from CPCC in December and am pursuing my Bachelors degree here. 
                    I am expected to graduate in 2026.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Academic Background:</span> I have been working in retail for roughly 3 years. 
                    Iâ€™ve been at Publix for a little over a year and before that I was at cvs. 
                    Before cvs I briefly worked as an electrical apprentice.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Background in this Subject:</span> I have mostly been working with Java through courses at CPCC. 
                    Outside of that I have learned a few things with html and c++. 
                    I also took a cybersecurity course and covered many topics in that field. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Primary Computer Platform:</span> Windows Desktop/Laptop</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:</span> 
                        <li class="indent"><span class="bold">ITSC 2175 - Logic and Algorithms -</span> Required and it seems interesting.</li>
                        <li class="indent"><span class="bold">ITSC 2181 - Intro to Computer Systems -</span> 
                            Required and this knowledge will help me pursue a different 
                            job opportunity at my current job. </li>
                        <li class="indent"><span class="bold"> 2600 - Program, Identity, Career -</span> 
                            Required but will hopefully help me find internship opportunities. </li>
                        <li class="indent"><span class="bold">ITIS 3135 - Web Based Application Design and Development -</span> 
                            Not required but I thought it would be interesting to learn more about. 
                            I also can use the knowledge from this course and apply it to careers.</li>        
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Interesting Item to Remember my by:</span> 
                    I am trying to collect more of the limited time crocs to wear but I only have Tow Mater and Shrek.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">I'd also like to Share:</span> Outside of work and school I enjoy playing soccer, going to the gym, or playing video games. </li>
